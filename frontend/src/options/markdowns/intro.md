## Why your comments may help blind people

Describing visual information can help blind and visually impaired people who cannot see the video adequately. Professionals add descriptions to the original audio tracks for films and some videos. It is not realistic to have every online video described by professionals or content creators, however, every ordinary audience like you has the power of contributing to the accessibility of the video you are watching ── by making your comment more accessible by clarifying the visual, or writing a descriptive comment, especially for an inaccessible segment!

When blind people are listening to the videos, we make a beep sound if helpful comments are available for a segment, then they can choose to pause the video, use screen readers to navigate, and read out the selected comments.


## Make your comment more accessible by clarifying the visual



* **Add timestamp if you are talking about specific segments of the video**
* **Avoid using ambiguous pronouns, such as it, that, or this, instead, use the full names or concepts you refer to**
* **If you share feelings on visual content not directly covered in the audio track, describe the visual content **

**Here is an example of modifying a comment: **



* **Original:** I like it when he walked in. The scene was so cool!
* **More accessible:** <span style="text-decoration:underline;">5:26</span> I like it when <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the vlogger’s friend</span> walked in. The scene of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all the lights turning on behind him</span> was so cool!

**Here are more examples of comments with clarified visuals:**



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1:29</span> WAIT A MINUTE! Taste perception is not localized like that in the brain. Different tastes are not processed in different parts of the cerebral cortex <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as the illustration showed</span>.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1:42</span> thanks, now my legs are going to be itchy for the rest of the video because of the little animation of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the spider moving on the skin…</span>


## Write a descriptive comment, especially for an inaccessible segment



* **Visual elements that are important to understand** what the video is communicating
    * **Objects (e.g. ingredients needed for a recipe)**
    * **Actions (e.g. a step in a tutorial video)**
    * **Scenes (e.g. a person studying)**
    * **Animations (e.g., an arrow showing the direction of force)**
    * **Texts (e.g., additional info not mentioned in the audio)**
* **Don’t **need to describe** every detail**
    * **Apparent** from the audio.  **(e.g.** **host speaking to camera)**
    * **Already mentioned/described in the audio**
* **The system may not identify every segment that deserves a description, feel free to add comments to where you think is meaningful!**

**Here are some examples of descriptive comments: **



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">0:28</span> I learned a little trick here: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reverse the pan and use the back of the pan to form the shape of foil</span>
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">0:45</span> She showed <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a white pan and a black pan</span>. If you use a black pan, remember to reduce the temperature of your oven by 25 degrees
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1:39</span> It seems that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">she used at least three eggs</span>
